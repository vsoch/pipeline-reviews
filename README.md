# Chip-Seq Review

Here I am going to do the following:

 1. Review the pipeline [here](https://www.encodeproject.org/chip-seq/histone/) and comment on the documentation. It was by accident from here that I figured out the pipeline "alien code" should link me to [this page](https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR970FPM/).  This wasn't the one that was linked from the Chip-Seq page so I'm guessing it is hidden?
 2. Attempt to run the pipeline in several ways
 3. Also give a try at a biological interpretation of the result

## Steps that I Took

 1. I was able to follow the link to create an account on DNANexus (not knowing what it is). I am not sure if I need to pay for this on my own (I hope not!). It might make sense for some tutorial to mention what it is, for noobs like me. I'm guessing it's an online platform to run genomics pipelines?
 2. I'm reading the same page, and there are links to "pipeline instances" (the pages with the pipeline identifiers that have tags as "experiment summary.") I'm not sure what an instance refers to, but I like the tag for "Encode Stage 3" because that tells me that (I think) it's something I should be interested in. I typed in [this link](https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR970FPM/) to match with the code I got to try, and I didn't know where to go from there. This appears to be describing (someone else's experimental data). I went back to the original page.
 3. Okay, now I'm a bit confused - the first set of links appear to be for different kinds of experiments (that were replicated) and then farther down a description of the pipeline inputs/outputs (this makes sense to have here) and below that a more hidden section with "References" that seem to be publications.
 4. Where are the "Hey Friend, let's get started!" sections?

## Suggestions

 - I'd really like to have a page, found right here, that walks me through how to run a pipeline. I would say that it should be specific to this exact pipeline. Right now I'd just be guessing that I need to dig through a Github repo, or some older publication, or DNANexus (and I don't know what it is) to get started. Coming from someone who has never used this site, it's not clear to me how to get started.
 - If the overview "last updated" date is manually done, it might make sense to have an automated date that updates when the docs are last built.
 - I've never used these pipelines so I'm not familiar with the coding schema (e.g., ENCSR970FPM). It might make sense to briefly mention this "the alphanumeric string is a unique identifier for..."
