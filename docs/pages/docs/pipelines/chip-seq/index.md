Hi Friend! Welcome to the documentation base to get you started using the [ChIP Pipeline](https://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/chip-seq-pipeline2). This is a work in progress, so if you have any questions please don't hesitate to reach out by posting on our [issue board](https://github.com/ENCODE-DCC/chip-seq-pipeline2/issues). What are we going to be doing today?

 1. Installing Dependencies
 2. Download Data
 3. Choosing where you want to run your pipeline
   a. [Google Cloud](#google-cloud)
   b. [DNAnexus](#dnanexus)


## Step 1: Install Dependencies

We are going to be using a Dockerized Cromwell. If you haven't already, read about how to set up Docker and Cromwell on our [setup page](/setup) and then come back here.

## Step 2: Get Data

(Not sure if I need to do this?)
> The raw data you need to run is on the Portal.  For example, https://www.encodeproject.org/experiments/ENCSR970FPM/ That experiment has already been run through the old (but still production) pipeline, so there are some outputs there.  Don’t worry about that.  What you want for your work is the fastqs.  You should also be able to find the control fastqs from that “experiment page”.

## Step 3: Choose Where to Run

These pipelines are quite substantial when it comes to data and analyses, so you should proceed learning about this pipeline by first choosing the environment you want to run it in.
